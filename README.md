Create a poem using Markov chain
We used Markov chain algorithm to produce a poem. we create new words based on previouse words and probabilities.
To biuld probabilities we create a dictionary which key is a word an its value is an array of words succeed.
Then we randomly found a word and possible words which follows.
We used the same algorithm with a bit change for a Persian short story to produce story.
The results are exciting.
